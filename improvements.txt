Use Boolean data member for tracking incident chords. We don't need to know how
many chords a vertex is incident to, we just need to know if it is incident to any.
We are currently using the int type, which uses 32 bits. Booleans use 1 bit.

Because of the low bound on vertex degree, the memory overhead of unordered_set is
unwarranted for the inner container of the adjacency list. The time-complexity hit
of using the standard ordered set is negligible due to the guaranteed low degree.

Remove DT from Graph object. Pass by reference when needed.
